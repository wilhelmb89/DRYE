SkinDRYE™ Technology uses a dual-layer system:<br/>•<strong> Inner layer:</strong> pulls sweat away from your skin instantly.<br/>• <strong>Outer layer:</strong> disperses and evaporates it before damage occurs.<br/><br/>By moving sweat outward, the textile reduces prolonged moisture exposure – a factor linked in research to Moisture-Associated Skin Damage (MASD), which is known to aggravate irritation, eczema flare-ups, and barrier breakdown. The effect: hands that feel drier and less friction – conditions shown to support the skin barrier during long glove use.</p>",
