Moisture was.<br/>Inside gloves, sweat accumulates quickly. Most materials — like cotton, silk, or bamboo — absorb that moisture but hold onto it. The skin stays damp, which softens the barrier and increases the likelihood of flare-ups and irritation.<br/><br/>During construction school, I experienced this daily. My hands would sweat, and every glove I tried made the problem worse.<br/>That’s when the focus shifted: not just to protect the hands, but to manage what happens inside the glove.</p>",
