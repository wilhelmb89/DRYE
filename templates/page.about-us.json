And most materials — like cotton, silk, or bamboo — trap that sweat against your skin.<br/>They absorb moisture but never let it go. So your hands stay damp, which breaks down the skin barrier, triggers flare-ups, and worsens irritation.<br/><br/>That was the real problem. Especially for people like me.<br/>In construction school, my hands would sweat constantly — and every glove just made it worse. I needed something different.<br/></p>",
