Developed over seven years in collaboration with Sweden’s top research institutions, these gloves use advanced moisture-wicking technology to help reduce issues like eczema, dermatitis, and Raynaud’s.<br\/><br\/>Made from sustainable wood cellulose, DRYE gloves create a breathable, hypoallergenic barrier that is gentle on the skin and designed for daily use. Unlike cotton, bamboo, and silk, DRYE gloves offer superior moisture control, making them a better choice for people with skin issues.<br\/><br\/>Continual use has been shown to reduce the need for costly creams and ointments. Lifespan: 3–12 months.<\/p>"

Start with Clean, Dry Hands: <\/strong>Before wearing your DRYE gloves, ensure your hands are clean and dry. This helps prevent trapped moisture, which could lead to irritation or discomfort. Proper hand hygiene is key to effective skin protection.<br\/><br\/><strong>2. Wear Under Gloves for Extra Protection: <\/strong>DRYE gloves can be worn under work, sport, or protective gloves for added protection. This extra layer helps shield your skin from dryness and irritants while allowing for comfort and full mobility.<br\/><br\/><strong>3. Wear Daily for Consistent Relief:<\/strong> For lasting relief from eczema, dry, or cracked skin, wear DRYE gloves daily. Regular use soothes skin, reduces flare-ups, and maintains a protective barrier against environmental triggers. Make them part of your daily routine for the best results.<br\/><br\/><strong>4. Wash & Reuse for Long-Term Durability: <\/strong>DRYE gloves are machine washable up to 90°C. After washing, air dry to maintain softness and effectiveness. Reuse regularly for continuous support, keeping the gloves fresh, hygienic, and durable<\/p>"
